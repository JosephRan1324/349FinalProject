## 🧑‍🍳 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cooking-web-app.git
cd cooking-web-app
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

> Make sure you're using a bundler like **Vite** or **Create React App** configured to allow local image imports from `/src/images`.

## 🖼️ Adding Images

- Place your image files inside `src/images/`.
- In `recipes.json`, reference them like this:

```json
"image": "/images/pumpkinPie.png"
```

- Webpack/Vite will resolve paths from `src/`, so make sure the folder and file names match.

## 🔧 Notes

- If you're using Vite, ensure that `server.allowedHosts` is correctly set in `vite.config.js` if you see a "Blocked request" error.
- For persistent storage (e.g., saving favorites), consider adding localStorage or connecting to a backend in future iterations.
